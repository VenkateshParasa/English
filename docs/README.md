## 🎓 Teaching Documentation

Before adding content or changing an exercise, read these — they define what the app is
supposed to teach and how it must give feedback:

- **[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md)** — **start here.** The running ledger of what is done, what
  is left in one-sitting chunks, open blockers, and the decisions already taken.
- **[REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)** — what the product must do and why. Personas, Telugu L1
  interference analysis, 66 functional and 17 non-functional requirements, constraints, traceability.
- **[PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md](PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md)** — epics, user stories with acceptance criteria,
  sprint slices, release plan, RAID log, definition of done.
- **[CURRICULUM.md](CURRICULUM.md)** — the syllabus. CEFR level framework, the six skill
  strands, what each currently covers, and a prioritised gap list.
- **[TEACHING_METHODOLOGY.md](TEACHING_METHODOLOGY.md)** — the pedagogy contract.
  Feedback rules per exercise type, spaced-repetition policy, level progression, tone.
- **[CONTENT_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](CONTENT_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md)** — data schemas for
  `data.js`, level-placement tables, and the pre-commit content checklist.
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** — the phased build plan for closing the
  gaps the audit found. Ten independently shippable phases, with per-phase verification.
